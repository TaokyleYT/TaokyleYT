Hi I am a guy who just code randomly in python and posts some of them here. 
my python codes are very very simple, probably students are better than me lol. 
its good to keep codes simple, so it is lot easier in debug and saves time. 
Sometimes you may find my simple codes intresting  (no its not gonna happen cuz almost all my codes are useless they can't even do anything helpful to you except wasting your time). 
Ye this is the end
