Hi I am a guy who just code random stuff in python and posts some of them here. <br>
my python codes are trash imo, but I will try to improve it. <br>
Sometimes you may find my simple codes intresting  (no its not gonna happen cuz almost all my codes are useless they can't even do anything helpful to you except wasting your time). <br>
Ye this is the end <br><br>
